              This would make a great airplane for someone on a tight budget. It
              has less than 8,000 hours total time and only 732 hours on a
              brand-new Pratt &amp; Whitney turbine engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inside is a bit rough because it was mostly used as a jump
              plane at a skydiving school in Florida. All the seats have been
              removed, but they are being sold with the airplane and could be
              reinstalled at relatively low cost. The money saved on the low
              purchase price would be more than enough to pay to have that done.
            </p>
            <p>
              The G1000 avionics package is fully functional and the IFR
              certification is valid for another 14 months.

              Fast, comfortable, and easy to fly. What else is there to say
              about this beautiful four-place single?
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a one-owner airplane. The previous owner was an A&amp;P
              and spared no expense on maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Total time on the airframe is 3,357 hours. The engine only has 129
              hours since it's last major overhaul. With a full glass cockpit,
              the only thing this airplane needs is you.

              What a find! Our buyers stumbled onto this gem at a pancake
              fly-in, believe it or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current owner was discussing upgrading when our buyer
              overheard. After a little back-and-forth, our buyer bought the
              plane on the spot. Yes, it's that nice! It's not as budget
              friendly as some our other airplanes but it's turnkey with plenty
              of time before anything will need to be done.
