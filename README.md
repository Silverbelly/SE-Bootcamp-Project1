# SE-Bootcamp-Project1

### Software Engineering Bootcamp - Project 1

Created by Jon Noel (Silverbelly), October 2024

##### Overview

This is the first project that is part of the UTA Software Engineering Bootcamp,
February 2025 cohort, of which I am a part. I chose to create a site for an
aircraft broker dealership because, well, I love general aviation. The site will
display aircraft for sale and allow interested users to request contact from a
sales person.

Planning documentation for the site is included in:
- User Stories.docx - the user stores for required functionality
- /wireframes - screen layouts

##### Basic functionality
- When users access the site, a home page will welcome them.
- Clicking/tapping the *Aircraft* nav menu item will direct users to a list of aircraft available for sale.
- Clicking/tapping the *Contact* nav menu item will direct users to a form to input their contact information.
- Clicking/tapping the *Home* nav menu item will direct the user back to the home page.

##### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap is leveraged for components (carousel, nav bar w/hamburger) creating a consistant look and feel.
- CSS is implemented in an custom style sheet for overriding Bootstrap colors and fonts.

##### Future Improvements
1. Add a blog feature where the broker can discuss details of new arrivals, or other aviation topics.
2. Add a subscribe feature to the contact form that allows users to subscribe to the broker's newsletter.
3. Add a scheduling feature that allows users to schedule an appointment with sales person.
