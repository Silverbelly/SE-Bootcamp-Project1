# SE-Bootcamp-Project1

### Software Engineering Bootcamp - Project 1

Created by Jon Noel (Silverbelly), October 2024

##### Overview

This is the first project that is part of the UTA Software Engineering Bootcamp,
February 2025 cohort, of which I am a part. I chose to create a site for an
aircraft broker dealership because, well, I love general aviation. The site will
display aircraft for sale and allow interested users to request contact from a
sales person.

Requirements and design documentation is included in the design-documents folder.

- project1-requirements.pdf (self-explanatory)
- User Stories.docx - the user stories for required functionality
- /wireframes - contains the wireframes and wireflow created using draw.io. For easy viewing in a browser, download and open the .html versions.

All website code, styles, and images in included in the website folder.

The website is hosted on Github pages [https://silverbelly.github.io/SE-Bootcamp-Project1/website](https://silverbelly.github.io/SE-Bootcamp-Project1/website)

##### Basic functionality

- When users access the site, a home page will welcome them.
- Clicking/tapping the _Aircraft_ nav menu item will direct users to a list of aircraft available for sale.
- Clicking/tapping the _Contact_ nav menu item will direct users to a form to input their contact information.
- Clicking/tapping the _Home_ nav menu item will direct the user back to the home page.

##### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap is leveraged for components (carousel, nav bar w/hamburger) creating a consistent look and feel.
- CSS is implemented in an custom style sheet for overriding Bootstrap colors and fonts.

##### Future Improvements

1. Add a blog feature where the broker can discuss details of new arrivals, or other aviation topics.
2. Add a subscribe feature to the contact form that allows users to subscribe to the broker's newsletter.
3. Add a scheduling feature that allows users to schedule an appointment with sales person.
